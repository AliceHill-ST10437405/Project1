        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p> The Kamatsogo Centre is a non-profit organisation providing employment opportunities, skills and empowerment to the local women of Vaalwater (South Africa), many of whom suffer from HIV/AIDS.
    
            The centre was started under the auspices of the Clive Walker Foundation in October 2006 with 6 unemployed women working in the Waterberg Welfare Society garage producing Christmas stockings after learning basic sewing skills. Kamatsogo now has its own NPO number and engages over 14 women who work daily at rented retail space at the main shopping centre in Vaalwater. Here, cushions, big five animal toys with the finest quality embroidery and beading, are reduced.
            Kamatsogo strives to positively affects the crafters lives, families and their local community as well as providing them with two meals a day. It gives each of the women a reason to wake up in the morning and go to work feeling like a contributing, valuable member of society.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Aim</h2>
            <p> 
                Our main aim is to alleviate poverty through production marketing and sales of local craft, as well as allowing individuals to gain skills.
            </p>
            <h2> Future Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Looking ahead our goals are to bring together more unemployed woman, who we are able to provide a job and skills to and spread the message of hope. More over we want to be able to create more projects through out South Africa.
